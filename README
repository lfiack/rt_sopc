rt_sopc
=======

rt_sopc is the Real-Time computing architecture of the Marcel robot. It is based on the openMSP430 from http://opencores.org/project,openmsp430

The openMSP430 is a synthesizable 16bit microcontroller core written in Verilog. It is compatible with Texas Instruments' MSP430 microcontroller family and can execute the code generated by any MSP430 toolchain in a near cycle accurate way.

Get the openmsp430 sources
--------------------------
The sources are already available in the directory named ./opencores/openmsp430/

$ svn export --username $USER http://opencores.org/ocsvn/openmsp430/openmsp430/trunk/ openmsp430
with $USER the name of your account on http://opencores.org/

Install gcc-msp430
------------------
On ubuntu 15.04 (should also do on other versions):

$ sudo apt-get install gcc-msp430
