rt_sopc
=======

rt_sopc is the Real-Time computing architecture of the Marcel robot. It is based on the openMSP430 from http://opencores.org/project,openmsp430

The openMSP430 is a synthesizable 16bit microcontroller core written in Verilog. It is compatible with Texas Instruments' MSP430 microcontroller family and can execute the code generated by any MSP430 toolchain in a near cycle accurate way.

Get the openmsp430 sources
--------------------------
The sources are already available in the directory named ./opencores/openmsp430/

$ svn export --username $USER http://opencores.org/ocsvn/openmsp430/openmsp430/trunk/ openmsp430
with $USER the name of your account on http://opencores.org/

Install gcc-msp430
------------------
On ubuntu 15.04 (should also do on other versions):

$ sudo apt-get install gcc-msp430

How to install Quartus and Modelsim
-----------------------------------
Installation:
$ wget http://download.altera.com/akdlm/software/acdsinst/15.1/185/ib_tar/Quartus-lite-15.1.0.185-linux.tar
(To compile stuff for the DE1, you need Quartus 13.0sp1. No documentation because it's temporary.)
$ tar xvf Quartus-lite-15.1.0.185-linux.tar
$ ./setup

Launch Quartus:
$ $QUARTUS_INSTALL_PATH/15.1/nios2eds/nios2_command_shell.sh #To deal with multiple installs
$ quartus

Launch Modelsim:
$ sudo apt-get install libxft2:i386 #We're in 2016 yo!

Add the following line in ~/.bashrc:
$ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/altera_lite/15.1/modelsim_ase/bin
